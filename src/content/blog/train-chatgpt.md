So, I wanted to start using ChatGPT to help me write blog posts, as I'm more of a video content creator. And I recently stumbled upon a compelling [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/ "train chatgpt to write like you") on training ChatGPT to mimic one's writing style. So, I put on my explorer hat and decided to dive into this digital expedition to see if ChatGPT could become my text-based doppelg√§nger. Here's how I did it:

## Step 1: Let Chatty know what you're up to

First things first, I had to let ChatGPT know what I was up to. Just like briefing a friend on a collaborative project, I handed over the prompt to ChatGPT. It was all about laying out my expectations and setting the tone for what was to come. Here's the prompt I used:

```
I'd like your help in creating articles for my blog itsthatlady.dev . Your first task will be to understand my writing style based on examples that I give you. After that, we'll create some content. To start, please say GO AHEAD and I will paste examples of my writing. Keep saying GO AHEAD and I will paste new examples. When I am done I will say FINISHED. At this stage, please do not do anything except confirm that you have saved the writing style. 
```

## Step 2: Sharing My Essence - feeding it examples

I shared snippets of my writing style so chatgpt knew exactly how I wrote and the tone and voice I use when writing. This will ensure that it captures the true nature of who I am as a writer so when it generates content, I don't have to do too much editing. The idea was to let ChatGPT groove to the rhythm of my writing. I fed it examples like [this blog post](https://itsthatlady.dev/ruby-for-beginners-a-complete-schedule-and-installation-guide/ "ruby beginners guide") and [this one](https://github.blog/2023-07-25-how-to-build-a-gpt-3-app-with-nextjs-react-and-github-copilot/ "build a gpt3 app") I wrote for work.

## Step 3: Name your writing style for easy reference

After handing over my writing samples, it was time to label this new writing style. Let's call it the "KK Style", shall we? I then nudged ChatGPT for a summary of the KK Style, to ensure we were on the same page. Here is the prompt:

```
Great. Let's call this "KK writing style". First, can you summarise KK writing style in a few bullet points? Focus on the sentence structure, tone and voice.
```

Here's how it explained my writing style - pretty spot on TBH:

```
Certainly! Here's a summary of the "KK writing style" based on the examples you provided:

Personal and Engaging Tone: The writing exudes a friendly and engaging tone, making the reader feel like they are having a conversation with you. It's approachable and encourages the reader to follow along in your journey or the instructions provided.

Informative and Clear: The writing is detailed and informative, providing clear instructions or insights to the reader. Each step or point is well-explained with an emphasis on helping the reader understand or learn something new.

Use of Casual Language and Emojis: Casual phrases and emojis are peppered throughout the text to create a relaxed and enjoyable reading experience. This also helps in making technical or complex topics more accessible.

First-Person Narrative: The use of first-person narrative makes the writing feel personal and relatable. It's as if the reader is getting advice or insights from a friend.

Use of Visuals and External Links: The inclusion of images, GIFs, and external links enriches the content, providing visual breaks and additional resources for the reader to explore.

Structured and Organized: The content is well-structured with headings, subheadings, and bullet points or numbered lists, making it easy to follow and digest.

Encouragement and Positive Affirmations: Phrases that encourage or appreciate the reader are used, creating a supportive and positive reading environment.

Humor: Light humor is sprinkled throughout the text, making the reading experience enjoyable and less formal.

These elements collectively contribute to a writing style that is both enjoyable and informative, making complex or technical topics accessible and engaging for a wide audience.
```

## Step 4: The Moment of Truth - ask chatty to write something

Now came the exhilarating part! I asked ChatGPT to craft a blog post based on a video script. And voila, here we are, reading the textual reflection of my video thoughts, curated by ChatGPT. You can see the video I'm referencing here: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyOYg1uA4bD/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyOYg1uA4bD/)

It‚Äôs such an uncanny experience seeing my video essence translated into words by ChatGPT.

## A New Dawn

This exploration opened up a realm of possibilities. With ChatGPT by my side, I can now dance between the realms of video and text, expressing my tech musings in more ways than one. And guess what? You can too! With a sprinkle of patience and a dash of curiosity, you could have your own AI buddy mirroring your writing style. üíÉüèΩ Just remember to go in and edit the generated content it gives you - you are still in charge afterall but it is a great jumping point to get you going!

So, are you ready to embark on this digital adventure and train ChatGPT to be your writing companion? It's a ride worth hopping on! Until next time, happy coding, and even happier blogging!

Catch you in the next byte!
