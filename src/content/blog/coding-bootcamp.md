This week I completed my first three weeks in Lambda School's part-time Full-Stack Web Engineering and Computer Science bootcamp. As the program is 18 months long, I have quite the way to go.

I wanted to take the time to write about what the part-time program is like for anyone considering enrolling in a PT cohort. I hope my insight will give you an idea of what to expect upon enrolling.

## Why I decided to attend Lambda School

Five months ago I had no idea what web development was. At the time I was searching for a more robust career trajectory and came across the world of software engineering and web development. After teaching myself HTML5/CSS3 on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) I decided in early January that I wanted to make this my new career path.

My intention was to use as many free resources and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) to further my education, build as many projects as possible and apply for a job within 9 months. It was all planned + going quite well until in late January I came across JavaScript and hit a mental roadblock. I realized that I needed a more structured learning path to assist me in my learning, and decided to apply to a bootcamp to accelerate && support my progress. Enter: [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/).

## The First Three Weeks
My cohort started on March 18th and I am honestly amazed at what I've been able to accomplish in the past three weeks as a part time student. For the first portion of the curriculum we focus on web development fundamentals. In 3 short weeks I have solidified my knowledge in semantic html5, CSS3, responsive web design and accessibility. 

During the first week I learned about Git and the command line and I must say that I am starting to get quite comfortable with using these essential web developer tools. I have created pull requests, cloned repositories, create branches in existing repos and have started to create really amazing relationships with students in my cohort. I also created my first portfolio website! How exciting!

## The Next Three Weeks
In the next three weeks I will have a solid understanding of pre-processing and start learning more about fundamental Javascript concepts. I will continue to do more advanced projects and continue to build relationships with the amazing students I am learning with.

If you would like to see what I have done so far, see my Github repos [here](https://github.com/LadyKerr?tab=repositories). 

Until next time, thanks for reading! :)
