Earlier this year I completed an AI & Machine Learning certificate program from Cornell University and it was the best and hardest thing I did for myself and my career. I learned SO MUCH and feel a lot better about using and teaching about AI (in my day job). I learned about fundamental concepts of machine learning, how to implement decision trees and build my own ML model. I learned how to evaluate a model, how to use pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks, overfitting, and so, so much more. I spoke briefly about my experience in [this video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA_8HJey4G9/).

The knowledge and skills I gained have truly set me up for success in the AI and ML space. However, the program came with a hefty price tag‚Äîover $3,000‚Äîwhich I was fortunate enough to have my job cover (thanks, GitHub!). For those who may not have the budget for such high-ticket courses, I‚Äôve curated a list of alternative, free resources that offer excellent foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in AI and ML.

These courses range from beginner-friendly introductions to more advanced, project-based content. If you're looking to level up your AI and ML skills without breaking the bank, here are my top recommendations:

### 1\. [AI for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners)

- **Description**: This is a 12-week, 24-lesson self-paced course designed to teach you everything you need to know about AI. It‚Äôs comprehensive and covers essential areas in AI.

- **Benefits**: By diving into topics like PyTorch, computer vision, neural networks, and TensorFlow, you‚Äôll gain a solid foundation in AI concepts and practical applications.

- **Pro Tip**: Complete each lab in the course to cement your understanding of the concepts. The hands-on approach will make the theory more applicable and easier to grasp in real-world scenarios.

### 2\. Fast.ai - [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

- **Description**: Fast.ai offers free, hands-on courses and resources focused on deep learning and machine learning. The courses are structured to be accessible and practical.

- **Benefits**: The project-focused lessons are ideal for anyone looking to work on real-world scenarios, plus there‚Äôs a supportive community to help along the way.

- **Pro Tip**: Start with the ‚ÄúPractical Deep Learning for Coders‚Äù course to get a comprehensive introduction to deep learning concepts and workflows.

### 3\. [ML for Beginners](https://github.com/Microsoft/ML-for-Beginners)

- **Description**: Similar to the AI for Beginners course, this is a 12-week, self-paced program that provides a thorough introduction to machine learning.

- **Benefits**: You‚Äôll learn to use Scikit-learn and other essential tools while building your own machine learning models. This course emphasizes practical skills that are highly applicable in real-world projects.

- **Pro Tip**: Make sure to complete all projects in the course. Not only will they solidify your learning, but they‚Äôll also give you a portfolio to showcase to potential employers or collaborators.

### 4\. [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

- **Description**: Kaggle is an online community for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. It offers mini-courses, datasets, notebooks, and competitions that let you practice and apply your skills.

- **Benefits**: With access to real-world datasets and competitions, Kaggle is a fantastic platform for hands-on learning. The community aspect also means you can connect with others, ask questions, and learn collaboratively.

- **Pro Tip**: Start with Kaggle‚Äôs beginner-friendly courses to build your foundational skills in ML & AI, and then participate in competitions to further challenge yourself and apply what you‚Äôve learned.

### 5\. [AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)

- **Description**: Created by Andrew Ng, this course on Coursera is a beginner-friendly introduction to AI, designed to make complex AI concepts accessible to everyone.

- **Benefits**: AI For Everyone covers AI basics and practical applications, making it ideal for both technical and non-technical professionals who want to understand the role of AI in various industries.

- **Pro Tip**: Focus on the sections about AI strategy and ethics to gain insights that go beyond coding. These sections will help you understand AI‚Äôs broader impact, which is especially useful for anyone interested in AI‚Äôs applications in business and society.

Embarking on an AI and ML learning journey doesn‚Äôt have to come with a hefty price tag. The courses above provide valuable, comprehensive insights that can set you up for success they‚Äôre all completely free! Start with one that matches your current skill level and interests, and work your way through the others to build up your skillset.

I don't regret the tears I've shed learning about AI & Machine Learning this year and I promise you won't either if you dedicate time and effort to it. Try one of these courses today and let me know which one resonates with you the most. And remember, the most important step is to start‚Äîno matter where you are on your learning journey.

Happy coding!
