If you're looking to transition into Software Development this year you may be wondering what language you should start learning first and which language is the best for a beginner.

In my opinion, **the best programming language to learn is the one that will land you the job that you want**. All languages serve a purpose and none of them are more important than the other. If you are looking for more direction and focus, keep reading as I explore the different roles in Software Development and the corresponding language that role needs.

## Roles in Software Development üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

#### Front-End Development

A _Front-End Developer_ builds and maintains user interfaces for applications and websites. Core languages and technologies used are **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**. Front-End Developers also need to be familiar with Javascript frameworks/libraries such as React, Vue and Angular in addition to CSS libraries/tools such as **styled-components, tailwind-css** and **SASS**.

There are many ways to be a Front-End Developer but if you think you're interested in this career path, start by learning the fundamentals of web development through this **100% free** online bootcamp - [FrontEnd Masters Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/ "https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/").

#### Back-End Development

A _Back-End Developer_ builds and maintains an application's server and databases. They also write application programming interfaces (API's) for the Front-End Developer to consume. Core languages used are **Python, NodeJs, Java** and **Ruby**. If you plan to be a backend developer, I recommend learning Python or NodeJS. They are two of the [most popular programming languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies "https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies") and have plenty of jobs available.

Back-End Developers must also be familiar with databases. These include **MySQL, PostgresSQL** and **MongoDB**. Understanding security, authentication, authorization and data structures & algorithms are also important to the backend developer's journey.

You can start learning backend development for free using the following resources:

- [FreeCodeCamp Python Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw")
- [FreeCodeCamp NodeJs Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE")
- [Learn Ruby for Free using App Academy Open](https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open "https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open")
- [Full Java Course with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34")

#### Full-Stack Development

A _Full-Stack Developer_ is able to build both the front-end and the back-end of an application. They can seamlessly go from building a beautiful user interface to updating the backend api and databases.

If you want to be a full-stack developer, I recommend that you learn **JavaScript** as this language can be used on both the front end and the back end of an app. I also recommend that you start by first learning front-end development and then venture into backend development while on your full-stack journey.

You can use the resources mentioned above to get started and you can also use this course to [learn full-stack development online for free.](https://www.simplilearn.com/free-online-full-stack-development-course-skillup "https://www.simplilearn.com/free-online-full-stack-development-course-skillup")

#### Mobile Development

A _Mobile Developer_ build mobile apps. They use technologies such as **Objective-C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, JavaScript,** and **React-Native.** They understand how to communicate with iOS and Android operating systems.

#### Game Development

A _Game Developer_ builds engaging and interactive gaming applications for web and mobile. Programming languages used include **C, C#, C++** and **Java** and they also use tools/frameworks such as **Unity 3D** and **OpenGL**. You can learn game development for free by taking one of these courses on Udemy: [Free Game Development Courses on Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/topic/game-development/free/ "https://www.udemy.com/topic/game-development/free/")

There are many other careers in Software Development that you can look into. However, the ones listed above is a great place to start.

Remember what I said before - **the best language to learn is the one that will get you the job you want**. It is up to you to figure out what role aligns with your career goals in order to choose what language to learn.

Every programming language is important - they all serve different purposes. Knowing where you want to fit within the world of Software Development will give you guidance on what language to start learning.

I hope this was helpful.

Happy coding friends!
